# The Digital Junk Drawer

Welcome to the **Digital Junk Drawer**! This is a community-driven collection of micro-web applications, classic games, and digital oddities. 

This project started as a personal collection of apps built out of boredom, but it has now evolved into an **Open Source community project**. Whether you have a small tool, a mini-game, or just a weird digital experiment, there is a place for it here!

> "One person's digital trash is another person's digital treasure."
